## Process

1. **Inspiration & Challenge**  
   I built this during the [Codedex Monthly Challenge](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/4QHMd8GadBZtZbq6W1wD) to level up my React and AI-prompting skills.
2. **Reference & Reboot**  
   Started by porting my old [Motivational Pok√©mon](https://motivational-pokemon.netlify.app/) project into React‚Äîbut ran into roadblocks.
3. **User Journey & Design**  
   Mapped the flow in FigJam, designed wireframes and polished UIs in Figma.
4. **Iteration & AI Integration**  
   Integrated chat logic with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, but hit walls around AI-response hooks.
5. **Tutorial Pivot**  
   Erased the tangled code and followed [Codedex‚Äôs ‚ÄúGenerate a Poem with Google Gemini‚Äù tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/generate-a-poem-with-google-gemini).
6. **Success!**  
   With that guide as a blueprint, the AI chat feature lit up exactly as expected.
